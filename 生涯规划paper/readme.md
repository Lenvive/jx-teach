## Intervention on carear readinenss
The study examines the efectiveness of a career intervention in middle schools. The 
intervention was organized in eight 45-minute-long group sessions. A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was applied, with 120 students in the experimental group and 156 in the control group. Small to medium-size efects were found in 
terms of reduction of lack of career information and an increase in independence in 
career decision-making. The observed efects were stable across gender and for high 
and low school achievers.

## Effectiveness of CDDQ
The aim of this study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of the Croatian paper and pencil and Internet versions of the Career Decision-Making Difficulties Questionnaire (CDDQ). The
CDDQ is based on the theoretical taxonomy of difficulties in career decision-making and comprises
three major clusters of difficulties: Lack of readiness, lack of information, and inconsistent information
that are further divided into 10 specific types of difficulties. The paper-and-pencil version and the
Internet version were filled out by 451 and 568 high school students, respectively. Both versions of the
Croatian CDDQ showed to be reliable and structurally equivalent measures. A hierarchical cluster
analysis and confirmatory factor analysis generally supported the three-cluster classification system of
career decision-making difficulties, with the exception of the Dysfunctional Beliefs Scale that was not
significantly associated with any of the other scales. The associations between the CDDQ Scales on
the one hand, and two measures of career maturity—Student Career Construction Inventory and
Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale—were moderate and negative and thus supported the
concurrent validity of the CDDQ. The results suggest revising the dysfunctional beliefs subscale or
using the CDDQ without this scale in counseling practice.

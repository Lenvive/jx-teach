## Intervention on carear readinenss
The study examines the efectiveness of a career intervention in middle schools. The 
intervention was organized in eight 45-minute-long group sessions. A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was applied, with 120 students in the experimental group and 156 in the control group. Small to medium-size efects were found in 
terms of reduction of lack of career information and an increase in independence in 
career decision-making. The observed efects were stable across gender and for high 
and low school achievers.
